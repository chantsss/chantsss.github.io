Hi, I’m Sheng Wang, a final year Ph.D. candidate at **the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology** (HKUST). I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Pedro V. SANDER](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~psander/) and Prof. [Junwei LIANG](https://junweiliang.me/). I had an unforgettable time at the Intelligent and Autonomous Driving Center (IADC), where I learned a great deal and enjoyed working alongside my colleagues.

Before joining HKUST, I completed my Master's degree in Advanced Robotics at **École Centrale de Nantes** (ECN), France, in 2020, and my Bachelor's degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering at **Harbin Institute of Technology** (HIT), China, in 2018.

My research interests span **supervised/self-supervised learning**, **reinforcement learning**, **decision making**, **generative models**, **distillation**, **autonomous driving**, **robotics** and related fields. I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions in autonomous systems to shape a safer and more efficient future. 

I’m currently looking for a job (both full time and intern) or a postdoc position, please feel free to drop me an email for any opportunities. You can find my resume here [![CV](https://img.icons8.com/material-outlined/24/000000/resume.png)](assets/pdf/Sheng_WANG_CV.pdf).
