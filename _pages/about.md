Hi, I’m Sheng Wang a Ph.D. candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Pedro V. SANDER](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~psander/) and Prof. [Junwei LIANG](https://junweiliang.me/).

Prior to joining HKUST, I earned my Master's degree in Advanced Robotics from **École Centrale de Nantes (ECN)**, France, in 2020, and a Bachelor's degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering from **Harbin Institute of Technology** (HIT), China, in 2018.

My research interests span **trajectory prediction**, **end-to-end planning**, **generative models**, **autonomous driving**, **robotics**, and related fields. I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions in autonomous systems to shape a safer and more efficient future.
