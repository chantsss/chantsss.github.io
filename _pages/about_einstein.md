Hi, I’m Sheng Wang, an optimistic pessimist and a Ph.D. student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Pedro SANDER](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~psander/) and Prof. [Junwei LIANG](https://junweiliang.me/).

Prior to joining HKUST, I earned my Master's degree in Advanced Robotics from École Centrale de Nantes, France, in 2020, and a Bachelor's degree in Optoelectronic Information Technology and Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2018.

My research interests span trajectory prediction, end-to-end planning, generative models, autonomous driving, robotics, and related fields. I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions in autonomous systems to shape a safer and more efficient future.
